### :star: Recap

:key: [Amazon Cognito][cognito] provides two different capabilities for managing users, federated identities and user pools. Amazon Cognito user pools handle almost any aspect about managing users, including login credentials, password resets, multifactor authentication and much more!

:wrench: In this module you used user pools to create a fully-managed user management system that allows you to authenticate your users and manage their user information. You updated your website to use the user pool, and used the AWS SDKs to provide a signin form on the site.

### Next
