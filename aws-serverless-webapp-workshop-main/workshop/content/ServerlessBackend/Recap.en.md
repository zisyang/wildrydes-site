### :star: Recap

:key: [AWS Lambda][lambda] is a serverless Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) product that removes the burden of managing servers to run your applications. You configure a trigger and set the role that the function can use and then can interface with almost anything you want from databases, to datastores, to other services either publicly on the internet or in your own Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). [Amazon DynamoDB][dynamodb] is a non-relational serverless database that can scale automatically to handle massive amounts of traffic and data without the need to manage any servers.

:wrench: In this module you created a DynamoDB table and a Lambda function to write data into it. In the next module, you create an Amazon API Gateway REST API and connect it to your application to capture ride details from your users.

### Next

:white_check_mark: After testing your new function using the Lambda console, you can move on to the next module, [RESTful APIs][restful-apis].
